TreeMix is a method for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in the history of a set of populations. In the underlying model, the modern-day populations in a species are related to a common ancestor via a graph of ancestral populations. We use the allele frequencies in the modern populations to infer the structure of this graph.
The details of the TreeMix model are presented in: Pickrell JK and Pritchard JK, Inference of population splits and mixtures from genome-wide allele frequency data.
Some extensions are presented in: Pickrell JK, Patterson N, Barbieri C, Berthold F, Gerlach L, GÃ¼ldemann T, Kure B, Mpoloka SW, Nakagawa H, Naumann C, Lipson M, Loh PR, Lachance J, Mountain J, Bustamante CD, Berger B, Tishkoff SA, Henn BM, Stoneking M, Reich D, Pakendorf B. The genetic prehistory of southern Africa.
We describe an application of this model to looking for natural selection in humans and dogs at Genomes Unzipped.
